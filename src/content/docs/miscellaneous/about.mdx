## About Pokemon Emerald Legacy docs & wiki

This wiki contains all information on the ROM hack Pokemon Emerald Legacy which is based on Pokemon Emerald. This site combines all the information found on YouTube, Reddit and Google Docs.

### Why make this into its own website?

- Better search & search engine
- Better navigation
- Better backup and history
- Better collaboration
- Less fragmentation
- Less reliant on a third party e.g. Reddit or Google Services

Generally, a lot of information from this hack is in various Google Docs documents or CSV files which search engines can't index. So I'm making this site to improve the UI, UX and search functionality to find the things you want quicker, to include a change history, allow for collaboration and edit requests and to generally have less fragmentation of the information as well as to be less reliant on a third party providers.
