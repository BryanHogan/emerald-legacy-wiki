title: Evolutions
description: Evolution requirement changes in Pokemon Emerald Legacy.
---

Sometimes, we will adjust the evolution method of a Pokémon to be different from base. There are two types of Evolution changes in Emerald Legacy: QoL, and Balance. 

**NOTE FOR EEVEE**: The time-based Eeveelutions, Espeon and Umbreon, are unchanged from Gen 3’s original system: Umbreon evolves in the AM hours and Espeon in the PM hours.

In the interest of promoting the single-player experience that ROMhacks favor, all trade evolutions are removed in favor of level-ups or, if the trade requires an item, using the item from your bag like a stone instead of the held method. As another QoL change from Crystal Legacy, Hitmontop has had its “balanced stats” evolution replaced with using the Brick Piece instead.

## List of evolution changes for balance

Some Pokémon are strong enough to be valuable in a playthrough, but their evolution just comes too late to capitalize on that. In these situations, we use an earlier evolution level as a method of buffing that Pokémon so it can have an impact sooner. These same changes were also ported forward from Crystal Legacy as a parity measure, so some Pokémon have evolution changes despite not being usable until endgame.
