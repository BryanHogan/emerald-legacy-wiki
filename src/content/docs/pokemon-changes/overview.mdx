The core of the Legacy games’ updates has always been the Pokémon themselves. Our aim is to find each Pokémon’s role, whether existing or implied, and give it changes to better fit that role so the player has the most interesting options as possible for their team. We are not trying to make every Pokémon an S-tier monster; that presents the same issue that the base games fall into, where every Pokémon is vying for the same roles and you’re locked into just picking the same things every time. If everything's the same then nothing feels special.  
Additionally, we absolutely **do not** change Pokémon types, as this is a slippery slope we feel quickly takes away from the “the way I remember” feeling that Legacy strives to preserve.

When balancing Pokémon, we primarily use the following changes to tune their capabilities:

<CardGrid>
	<LinkCard  title="Learnsets" href="/pokemon-changes/learnsets" description="The moves at a Pokémon’s disposal can make or break their role in a team. We start here first, because often just gaining access to a few more options can redeem something." />
	<LinkCard  title="Stats" href="/pokemon-changes/stats" description="If an updated learnset can’t quite cut it, we then turn to a Pokémon’s stats. Usually 20 points here or 10 there can give something just the edge it needs, but in rarer cases a heavier buff or a rebalance of stats entirely is necessary." />
	<LinkCard  title="Evolution" href="/pokemon-changes/evolution" description="Most of our Evolution changes are for QoL purposes, to make playing solo easier. However, sometimes we’ll also change an evolution level just to make a Pokémon better fit the game’s difficulty curve with its power spikes." />
	<LinkCard  title="Location" href="/pokemon-changes/locations" description="Much like real estate, location is everything. A mid-power Pokémon in Victory Road is a sorry addition to your team, but if it was available to help you before the second gym it can really shine. Many Pokémon have had their availability adjusted so they appear at a more suitable time in the game to stand out against the crowd." />
	<LinkCard  title="Abilities" href="/pokemon-changes/abilities" description="Gen 3 offers a new and powerful wrinkle in Pokémon design that gives us one more method to power up a Pokémon. We tried to be reserved in our approach to changing Abilities, but we did give the following Pokémon some new options." />
